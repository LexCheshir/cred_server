## Hey, Pikat!

Just run main.py :3

## on more serious note:

1) If you have python + poetry:

poetry run python main.py

or

poetry install
poetry shell
python main py


2) No poetry (if you want to use virtual env than do it: you know how to do it)
 
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn
python main.py
